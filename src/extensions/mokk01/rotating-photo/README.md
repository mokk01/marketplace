# Rotating Photo Player

A Spicetify extension that replaces the standard album art with a smoothly rotating photo.

## Features
- **Smooth 360° Rotation**: Animates the photo to spin continuously.
- **Dynamic Overlay**: Covers the album art in both the bottom-left player and the side "Now Playing" panel.
- **Record Effect**: Gives the player a unique, vinyl-like feel.

## How it works
This extension targets the CSS classes used by Spotify for album art and overlays a custom image element that spins using CSS animations.

## Installation
After installing via the Marketplace, the extension will automatically activate.
